# Book-Analytics-with-Recommendation-System
Title:  Web analytics on people’s book preferences.

Description: 
The project will involve: 
1.	Conversion of dataset from .csv format to RDF/XML format.
2.	Recommend books to users based on their previous reads.
3.	Top 10 books of the year based “city” wise based on ratings. 
4.	Top 10 books of the year “age” wise based on ratings.
5.	Top 10 books of the year based “country” wise based on ratings. 
6.	Most successful publisher and popular author based on ratings each year. 

Data Source:  
We collected the information about books based on a csv data found at http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/ The information includes three diverse data sets:
a)	Demographic information about readers (anonymized)
b)	Book information - `Book-Title`, `Book-Author`, `Year-Of-Publication`, `Publisher` obtained from Amazon.
c)	Rating information - 100,000 ratings (1 to 5) from 20000 users on 20000 books.

Expected Results:
a)	Given a group/city/country, System will display books for each age group, city and country. 
b)	Based on a series of book selections, System will recommend new books to users.
c)	System can extract reporting data - e.g. popular authors and successful publishers for each year.
d)	A Graphical representation of all the results using plotting tools.
This data once combined and represented as RDF can be useful for any online websites selling books to recommended books to users. They can also increase the sale of their products based on the user data such as favorite author.
